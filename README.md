# keyboardLogger
I have created a keyboard logger that logs inputs from the user over a period of time and generates a heatmap showing the usage. It will run a daemon that keeps a log of all the keyboard keys pressed.
It contains a GUI that displays heatmaps of the keys that are pressed. To develop this project I have used python. When the user gives the keyboard input it will store data in backend file (Csv). When we enter genHeatMap.py in cmd then it will generate display the heatmap output.
